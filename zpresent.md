React E-Commerce Advanced: Testing & Deployment

1. Firestore Migration Implementation

Key Files:
- src/pages/Home.tsx
- src/services/productService.ts

The application features a two-phase approach for seeding the Firestore database:

- Detection Phase: Checks for existing products in Firestore
- Migration Phase: Seeds initial product data from external API when needed

Key implementation points:
- Home component checks for empty Firestore on mount (useEffect)
- Product service handles the API fetch and batch document creation
- Error handling prevents duplicate migrations

2. Testing Implementation

Jest & Testing Library Setup

Key Files:
- jest.setup.ts
- jest.config.ts
- src/__mocks__/firebaseConfig.ts

Setup details:
- Global mocks for Firebase Auth and Firestore in jest.setup.ts
- Environment variables mocking for Vite compatibility
- Custom test utilities for common rendering patterns

Component Tests

1. Home Component Tests

Key File: src/pages/Home.test.tsx

Test coverage:
- Tests loading, error, and success states
- Verifies Firestore migration is triggered when needed: 
  expect(migrateProductsFromAPI).toHaveBeenCalled()
- Validates product rendering and cart integration

2. Authentication Tests

Key Files:
- src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx
- src/components/AdminRoute.tsx
- src/hooks/useAuth.ts

Test coverage:
- Validates protected routes behavior
- Tests admin access control
- Verifies auth state management through custom hook tests

3. Cart & Checkout Tests

Key Files:
- src/pages/Cart.test.tsx
- src/pages/Checkout.test.tsx

Test coverage:
- Tests Redux state management with mock store
- Validates navigation between cart and checkout
- Verifies order submission with Firestore mocks

3. CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions Workflow

Key Files:
- .github/workflows/main.yml
- package.json

Pipeline features:
- Automated testing on every push and pull request
- Deployment to Vercel only after successful tests
- Environment variable handling through Vercel integration
