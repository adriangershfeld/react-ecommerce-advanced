# React E-Commerce Advanced: Testing & Deployment

## 1. Firestore Migration Implementation
**Key Files:** `src/pages/Home.tsx`, `src/services/productService.ts`

The application features a two-phase approach for seeding the Firestore database:

- **Detection Phase:** Checks for existing products in Firestore
- **Migration Phase:** Seeds initial product data from external API when needed

Key implementation points:
- Home component checks for empty Firestore on mount (`useEffect`)
- Product service handles the API fetch and batch document creation
- Error handling prevents duplicate migrations

## 2. Testing Implementation

### Jest & Testing Library Setup
**Key Files:** `jest.setup.ts`, `jest.config.ts`, `src/__mocks__/firebaseConfig.ts`

- Global mocks for Firebase Auth and Firestore in jest.setup.ts
- Environment variables mocking for Vite compatibility
- Custom test utilities for common rendering patterns

### Component Tests

#### 1. Home Component Tests
**Key File:** `src/pages/Home.test.tsx`

- Tests loading, error, and success states
- Verifies Firestore migration is triggered when needed: `expect(migrateProductsFromAPI).toHaveBeenCalled()`
- Validates product rendering and cart integration

#### 2. Authentication Tests
**Key Files:** `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`, `src/components/AdminRoute.tsx`, `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`

- Validates protected routes behavior
- Tests admin access control
- Verifies auth state management through custom hook tests

#### 3. Cart & Checkout Tests
**Key Files:** `src/pages/Cart.test.tsx`, `src/pages/Checkout.test.tsx`

- Tests Redux state management with mock store
- Validates navigation between cart and checkout
- Verifies order submission with Firestore mocks

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow
**Key Files:** `.github/workflows/main.yml`, `package.json`

- Automated testing on every push and pull request
- Deployment to Vercel only after successful tests
- Environment variable handling through Vercel integration

### NPM Scripts Integration
**Key File:** `package.json`

- Dedicated test commands for local and CI environments
- Watch mode for development testing
- Reporting configuration for GitHub Actions integration

## 4. Key Features Implementation
**Key Files:** `src/App.tsx`, `src/store.ts`, `src/services/orderService.ts`

### Authentication & Authorization

- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Role-based access control (admin vs. regular users)
- Protected routes with redirect behavior

### State Management

- Redux for cart state with persistence
- React Query for server state and caching
- Custom hooks for auth state

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive try/catch blocks throughout the codebase
- Fallback UI states for loading/error conditions
- Form validation with user feedback

### API Integration

- Firestore for data persistence
- External API integration (FakeStore)
- Batch operations for performance

### User Experience

- Responsive design across device sizes
- Graceful degradation for network issues
- Progressive enhancement with meaningful feedback
